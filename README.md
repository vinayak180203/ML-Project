<h2>Description</h2><br>
To build a model which which will recommend movies to users based on the previous ratings given by them to some movies.<br>
<h2>To Run</h2><br>
First we have to link the datasets with our notebook and to do that we have to do the following steps.<br>
<b>1.</b> Check the files in data folder.<br>
<b>2.</b> Download them.<br>
<b>3.</b> Make a folder in your drive as Datasets and copy the files downloaded in this folder.<br>
<b>4.</b> Define the path of the csv file in the Notebook.<br>
<h2>Progress Made</h2><br>
We have used two matrix factorization-based collaborative filtering models (one with movie meta-data and one without it) and also one neural netwok model.<br>
